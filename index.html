                Aang, Firelord Zuko, and Sokka of the Southern Water
                Tribe. Republic City is a place where people of all the
                nations, benders and non-benders, can live together in

                Republic City is the capital of the United Republic of
                Nations and governed by a council. The land city is
                built on what was once a Fire Nation colony in the
                Earth Kingdom. The city has a great reputation of being
                one of the most modern cities in the world.
